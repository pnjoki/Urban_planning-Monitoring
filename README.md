I used the R programming language to derive and visualize four key spectral indices, including NDVI, GVI, MNDWI, and NDBI, for Blantyre City.
Working with satellite data in R allowed me to transform raw pixels into meaningful environmental insights:

🔹 NDVI – Vegetation Health
 Reveals the distribution of healthy vegetation across the city. The greener areas highlight zones contributing positively to urban ecology.

🔹 GVI – Green Vegetation Index
 Captures dense vegetation with remarkable clarity, helping identify critical green corridors.

🔹 MNDWI – Water Index
 Shows minimal water presence in the imagery, an important indicator for studying water scarcity and hydrological patterns.

🔹 NDBI – Built-Up Index
 The red tones expose built-up and rapidly urbanizing areas—useful for understanding settlement expansion and land-use pressure.

What makes this work special is not just the mapping itself, but how R empowers researchers to combine statistical computing, environmental modeling, and spatial analysis in one workflow. Every line of code helps translate satellite imagery into actionable knowledge for urban planning, environmental health, and climate adaptation.
